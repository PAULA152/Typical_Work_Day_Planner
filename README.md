# Typical_Work_Day_Planner
 
 I made an application using tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap that creates a work day scheduler.
 This also features a clock that has the current date and time locally updated in real time.
 The planner can save what you write down as an event and has a reset scheduler.
